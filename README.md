# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
<h1>Boston Bus Tracker: MIT to Harvard</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I used the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT. Then, I added an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes. I created a Mapbox account and got an access token. Then I added the access token to the mapboxgl instance and defined the mapanimation.js. Next I created a marker and added it to the map using the mapboxgl pre-built functions. Finally the function move() is called when the button “Show stops between MIT and Harvard” is selected. This is how I started the marker animation. You should be able to see a marker moving from one bus stop to the next on the map.


How to Run: Hit the button and watch the marker move!

Roadmap of future improvements: I would like to create a more zoomed out version of the map, so that it can track all the destinations that I have travelled to in the last 12 months.
